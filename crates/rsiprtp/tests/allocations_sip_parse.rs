//! Allocation-count regression test for `SipMessage::parse`.
//!
//! The in-tree parser at `src/sip/parser/` replaced the `rsip = "0.4"`
//! dependency in the M1–M9 rewrite (HLD: 2026-05-03). One of the
//! advertised wins of that rewrite was a sharp drop in per-INVITE
//! allocations. This test locks in those gains: every fixture has a
//! measured baseline plus a small headroom; if the parser starts
//! allocating beyond that budget, the assertion fires and points at
//! the offending fixture.
//!
//! ## Methodology
//!
//! The `#[global_allocator]` declaration here is **scoped to this
//! test binary only** — each Rust integration test under `tests/`
//! compiles to its own binary, so neither production code nor any
//! sibling test sees `StatsAlloc`.
//!
//! `Region::new` snapshots the allocator counters; the `change()`
//! delta after parsing is what we assert against. Fixtures are
//! pulled in via `include_bytes!` so file I/O is not part of the
//! measurement.
//!
//! ## Why a single `#[test]` for all fixtures
//!
//! `StatsAlloc` counters are process-wide, not thread-local. If each
//! fixture were its own `#[test]`, cargo's default scheduler would
//! run them on multiple threads concurrently, and any sibling
//! thread's allocations would land inside another test's `Region`
//! window and inflate its count. We saw ~40% flakiness with four
//! parallel `#[test]` functions even with a measurement mutex —
//! the mutex serializes the *measurement* but not the *threads*. So
//! the budget assertions live in a single `#[test]` that walks the
//! fixtures sequentially, accumulating per-fixture failures into one
//! diagnostic message.
//!
//! ## What we assert on
//!
//! Only `stats.allocations` (the count). `bytes_allocated` is
//! sensitive to the exact `String`/`Vec` growth path the parser
//! takes and is more brittle in the face of harmless internal
//! tweaks; the count is what we actually care about for "did the
//! parser regress?".
//!
//! ## Modes of operation
//!
//! There are two budget sets per fixture:
//!
//! - `*_BUDGET` — measured under plain `cargo test`.
//! - `*_BUDGET_UNDER_COVERAGE` — measured under `cargo llvm-cov`,
//!   which is how stage 7 of `tools/full_test` runs us.
//!
//! At runtime, `invite_allocation_budgets` picks one of the two by
//! checking `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE`. Both sets are real assertions —
//! there is no skip path. The earlier (now-removed) skip silently
//! disabled this oracle in the test-bar pipeline; see the HLD
//! `wrk_docs/2026.05.06 - HLD - alloc budget under coverage.md` for
//! why we chose runtime detection over `cfg(coverage)`.
//!
//! ## Refreshing the budgets
//!
//! Both budgets must be refreshed together when the parser is
//! intentionally re-tuned. Run **both** of these and update **both**
//! constant families:
//!
//! ```text
//! # No-coverage baseline (updates *_BUDGET):
//! cargo test -p rsiprtp --test allocations_sip_parse \
//!     -- --ignored --nocapture discover_baselines
//!
//! # Under-coverage baseline (updates *_BUDGET_UNDER_COVERAGE).
//! # `--no-cfg-coverage` mirrors stage 7 of the test bar at
//! # `tools/full_test/src/main.rs` — measure the *exact* config
//! # that runs in CI, not a slightly different llvm-cov mode:
//! cargo llvm-cov test -p rsiprtp --test allocations_sip_parse \
//!     --no-cfg-coverage -- --ignored --nocapture discover_baselines
//! ```
//!
//! For each fixture, apply
//! `max(measured + 4 + spread, ceil(measured * 1.15))` to set the
//! budget. On Windows MSVC + cargo-llvm-cov 0.8.5 today, the two
//! budgets coincide because the coverage runtime emits static
//! counters that don't allocate; on a future toolchain the
//! under-coverage value may shift (HLD §6 R1). If the under-coverage
//! ratio diverges sharply (more than ~5x the no-coverage value),
//! suspect a coverage-tool change rather than a parser regression.
//!
//! A maintainer who refreshes only one of the two will get a sharp
//! failure on the next test bar run — the failure message names the
//! out-of-budget constant, which makes "you forgot to refresh the
//! other one" the obvious diagnosis.
//!
//! ## Known limitation: stale `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE`
//!
//! A developer with a stale `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` exported in their
//! shell (e.g. left over from a prior `cargo llvm-cov` run) will
//! select the under-coverage budget under plain `cargo test`. The
//! oracle still fires — it's just slightly looser than intended in
//! that one shell session. We accept this rather than add
//! belt-and-braces secondary detection (HLD §1).

// Budget constants. Two parallel sets per fixture:
//
//   *_BUDGET                  — measured under plain `cargo test`.
//   *_BUDGET_UNDER_COVERAGE   — measured under `cargo llvm-cov`,
//                               which is how stage 7 of the test bar
//                               (`tools/full_test`) runs us.
//
// The two-tier scheme exists because coverage instrumentation may
// inject heap activity for `__llvm_profile_*` counters on covered
// branches; the count is platform-dependent (effectively zero
// inflation on Windows MSVC + cargo-llvm-cov 0.8.5 today, but other
// toolchains may differ). Asserting only the `cargo test` budget
// would silently disable the oracle under stage 7; asserting only
// the loosest of the two would let no-coverage regressions slip.
// Mode is picked at the call site via `under_coverage_instrumentation()`.
//
// Formula for both: max(measured + 4 + spread, ceil(measured * 1.15)),
// where `spread = max - min` over N=5 consecutive measurement runs.
// The +4 floor keeps tiny fixtures from asserting on a literally-zero
// headroom; the 1.15x multiplier allows for harmless refactors (e.g.
// one extra `String::from` for a header parameter); `spread` absorbs
// run-to-run measurement noise.
