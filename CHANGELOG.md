## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- **rsip dependency dropped from runtime deps.** rsip remains in
  `[dev-dependencies]` indefinitely as the differential-test oracle
  for `tests/parser_diff.rs`. The library builds and runs without
  rsip; downstream consumers no longer pull rsip transitively.
- **`rsiprtp::sip::RsipUri`** re-export of `rsip::Uri`. The wrapper layer
  no longer leaks rsip types across its public boundary.
- **`SipRequest::inner()`** and **`SipResponse::inner()`** — the
  `&rsip::Request` / `&rsip::Response` escape hatches. They had zero
  callers inside `rsiprtp` and were the last public rsip-typed
  accessors.
- **`Method::to_rsip()`** and the **`impl From<&rsip::Method> for Method`**
  bridge. With M8's cutover to parser-native storage these no longer
  have any in-tree caller; the previous `method_to_rsip` shim is also
  gone. Callers that previously bridged from rsip to ours via
  `Method::from(&rsip_method)` now round-trip via the canonical
  method-name string with the new `Method::FromStr` impl, which is
  lossless for all 14 variants.

### Added

- **`impl FromStr for Method`** with case-insensitive parsing per RFC
  3261 §7.1, replacing the removed rsip bridge as the canonical way to
  reconstruct a `Method` from a string token.

### Changed

- **`SipRequest::uri`**, **`from_uri`**, **`to_uri`**, **`contact_uri`**,
  **`from_tag_and_uri`**, and **`SipResponse::contact_uri`** now return
  `SipUri` (owned) instead of `rsip::Uri` (`&rsip::Uri` for `uri`,
  `Result<rsip::Uri>` / `Option<rsip::Uri>` for the others). The
  `Display` impl is identical, so call sites that did `.to_string()` on
  the old return value need no change. Test sites that asserted on
  `rsip::Uri`'s structural fields move to `SipUri`'s accessors.
- **Internal storage of `SipRequest` / `SipResponse` is now the in-tree
  parser type** (`parser::Request` / `parser::Response`). The wrapper
  layer no longer holds rsip types — accessors project from
  parser-native data. Public API contract from M7 is preserved.

### Security

- **Request-URI validated at framing time.** `parse_request_line` now
  runs the Request-URI through `SipUri::parse` and rejects any URI
  the owned-form decoder cannot accept (e.g. `http://`, malformed
  schemes). Previously the framer accepted any whitespace-bounded
  token, and `SipRequest::uri()` would panic downstream — an
  attacker-controlled DoS on the inbound path. Inputs that survive
  framing are now guaranteed to round-trip through `SipUri::parse`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-02

### Removed

- **DTLS-SRTP stub** (`rsiprtp::srtp::dtls`). The module never contained a DTLS handshake — only fingerprint parsing, role enums, and a use-srtp-extension codec. SRTP key exchange is via SDES only. If DTLS-SRTP support arrives later it will be designed against an actual DTLS crate, not retrofitted onto these types.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-01

### Added

- SRTP and ICE/STUN/TURN types are now reachable through the published facade
  as `rsiprtp::srtp` and `rsiprtp::ice`.

### Changed

- **Workspace collapsed into a single publishable crate.** The eleven internal
  `rsiprtp-*` crates (core, sip, transaction, dialog, transport, sdp, rtp,
  srtp, ice, media, session) are now modules of the `rsiprtp` crate. Source
  layout is unchanged for end users — `rsiprtp::sip::…`, `rsiprtp::rtp::…`,
  etc. resolve as before.
- **Minimum supported Rust version is now 1.88** (previously 1.75). Required
  by `ropus 0.12` (typed runtime bitrate API used by the BitrateBridge) and
  the `time 0.3.47` transitive via `ezk-g722`. Downstream consumers upgrading
  from 0.1.x will need a newer toolchain.
- Minor clippy / MSRV idiom cleanups under stable rustc (`is_multiple_of`,
  `Duration::abs_diff`, `collapsible-match`).

### Removed

- **`opus` feature flag** — Opus codec is now built in. `ropus` is pure-Rust
  and was already unconditionally enabled by `rsiprtp-session`; the flag had
  no off-state and is gone.
- **`dtls` feature flag** and the optional `openssl` dependency. The
  DTLS-SRTP framing types remain in `rsiprtp::srtp`; the handshake itself is
  not yet implemented, so there was nothing for `openssl` to gate.
- Unused `crossbeam` and `dasp` dependencies.
- Heavyweight baresip / Asterisk integration test fixtures from the published
  tarball (`package.exclude`). The framework stays in the repository for
  local use.

### Fixed

- `RegistrationManager::needs_refresh` no longer panics on Windows hosts
  within roughly twelve minutes of system boot. The check used unchecked
  `Instant` subtraction; it now uses saturating arithmetic.
- `generate_tag()` no longer produces duplicate tags on macOS under load.
  The previous implementation seeded from `SystemTime`, whose resolution on
  macOS is too coarse to distinguish back-to-back calls; it now draws from
  `rand::thread_rng()`.
